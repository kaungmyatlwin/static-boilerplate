# Simple Static Boilerplate

## What?

A simple CLI tool with hot reload feature, SCSS auto complier and builder.

## Why?

SASS compiler softwares are nice, but nice ones come with prices. We've been using Prepos for SCSS compiling but it is pretty annoying when it randomly pops up during work.

I created this boilerplate out of curiosity for Gulp and thought of "simple CLI tool with hot reload features and scss auto complier would be nice and help speed up things". On the plus side we can have more consistent directory structure and as I said before, it will help speed up things.
